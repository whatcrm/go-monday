![Monday API Library](.github/monday_logo.png?raw=true)

**go-monday** is a Rest API for Monday CRM. You can manage
your application with this library. It contains almost every
API request Monday provides with support of CRUD operations.

## Quick Start / Installation

To get started with **go-monday**, you'll need to do the following:

- Install the latest version of Go.
- Install the **go-monday** package using go get.
- Use the **go-monday** package in your Go code.
- Here's an example of how to install the package:

```
go get github.com/whatcrm/go-monday
```

## Models

**go-monday** includes a package for working with models, which allows you to use just the API and **create your own models**.
This means you can create your own structs and use them with our **go-monday** package, 
even if you don't want to use every field from Monday's entities.

Here's the link to [Models](https://github.com/whatcrm/go-monday/models) package and example of how to install the package.

```
go get github.com/whatcrm/go-monday/models
